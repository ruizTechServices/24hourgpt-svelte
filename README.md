#This is the repository for 24-Hour GPT

This is a repository for 24-hour GPT but written in Svelte using SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. I am using Svelte authentication 
and will enable users to login with their Google account. This will enable users to save their chat history and to pay for using the
platform. 

I need to start with the login and auth for the app. Users must have their own login and their own collection in the database.
